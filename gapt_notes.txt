Notes:

•SibSp = Number of Siblings/Spouse
•Parch = Number of Parents/Children

•Possible Feature: IsAlone

•Embarked is usually imputated with the mode.

•There are many approaches of handling the Cabin feature. 70%+ of the data is missing.

•Age must also be imputated.

•The Higher a Tourist paid, the higher the chances of survival.

•Encode Strings/Objects into numerical values. (eg. male = 0, female = 1)

•Explore interesting themes: (Wealthy Survive?, By Location, Age Scatterplot with ticket price, Total spent)
